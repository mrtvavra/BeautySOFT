# BeautySOFT
A simple online booking system called BeautySOFT for small (or start-up) Beauty salons that can replace an old paper-based booking system.

This web application is the part of the final university project module, which was based on project management during the software development.
For this reason the application consists only simple functionality with very simple user interface form. 
I have developed the application by using Java programming language and Model-View-Controller architecture pattern that facilitates the
separation of the system. 
The system has been implemented by using several technologies including Java EE, EJBs, JavaServer Faces web framework, Facelets, HTML, 
relation-database management system (RDMS) Apache Derby, NetBeans IDE etc.

In order to run the application, the application needs be connected('registered') to the implemented Apache Derby database (also provided 
in repository folder: BeautySOFT/Code/BeautySOFT_database/.netbeans-derby)

To register/connect the database with the application:
Run NetBeans IDE ->
Under Services, open the Databases node ->
Right-click on Java DB and select properties ->
In the Database Location field, enter the path to the copied folder, i.e. yourLocation/BeautySOFT/Code/BeautySOFT_database/.netbeans-derb

The repository also consist the design of the system and the database.

I hope you find it helpful.
